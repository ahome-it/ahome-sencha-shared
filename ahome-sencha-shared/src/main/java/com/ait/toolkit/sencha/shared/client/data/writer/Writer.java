 * Base Writer class used by most subclasses of Ext.data.proxy.Server. This

 * For example a Ext.data.writer.Json would format the Operations and their
 * Ext.data.Model instances based on the config options passed to the
 * JsonWriter's constructor.
 * <p>
 * s Writers are not needed for any kind of local storage - whether via a Web
 * Storage proxy (see localStorage and sessionStorage) or just in memory via a
 * MemoryProxy.
